Simple DDC simulator


This is a simple DDC simulator, aimed at quick idea proofing at LNLS. This is NOT an optimal tool, nor is intended to be run at real time. Indeed, this project avoid some good GNURadio blocks in order to allow easier tinkering with the processing chain.

Try to see this project as a typical MATLAB simulation powered by GNURadio and Python for extra power and flexibility, not a typical GNURadio application.
